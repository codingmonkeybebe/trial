    **Investment Opportunity Overview**

    This vessel leasing project models a container ship of approximately {vessel_teu:,} TEU operated by {carrier}, one of the top 20 global containership liners.
    The total investment including vessel price and pre-delivery related costs is approximately USD {initial_investment / 1_000_000:,.2f} million. Operating expenses and dry docking costs escalate annually at {annual_escalation_pct * 100:.2f}% over a {project_life_years}-year term.

    Recent industry reports highlight strong newbuilding orders with en bloc deals for vessels similar in size to {vessel_teu} TEU priced around USD 90-140 million, e.g., the Hapag Lloyd contract for 12 Post Panamax vessels near 9,200 TEU at approx. USD 140 million each.
    Daily TC rates in the market for prime operators typically range USD 35,000 to 45,000 for these sizes, aligning well with the model's base TC rate of USD {tc_rate_input:,.0f}/day.
    Industry forecasts note intensifying competition driven by fleet capacity growth (over 350 vessels added in 2024-2025) and evolving environmental regulations impacting operating costs and Charter Party terms.

    The target annualized IRR of {irr_annual * 100:.2f}% fits within market expectations of 8-14% for containership leases, reflecting balanced risk-return.
    To secure this deal, Seaspan should leverage milestone payments aligned with construction progress, negotiate flexibly on fuel transition and environmental compliance costs, and capitalize on its fleet scale and operational efficiencies.
    Transparent risk-sharing and cost-control provisions will enhance charterer confidence amid volatile freight rate conditions.

    Recent comparable transactions illustrate vessels priced between USD 90-110 million with similar TEU and TC rates chartered by industry leaders such as Maersk, MSC, and CMA CGM.
    Despite global trade uncertainties and excess supply risk, the structured milestone approach and sensitivity analysis enable informed investment decisions and highlight pricing flexibility to meet IRR targets.
